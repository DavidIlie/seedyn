# deepsec

This directory holds the [deepsec](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deepsec)
config for the parent repo. Checked into git so teammates inherit
project context (auth shape, threat model, custom matchers); generated
scan output is gitignored.

Currently configured project: `seedyn` (target: `..`).

## Setup

The Seedyn project is initialized and its reviewed threat model lives in
`data/seedyn/INFO.md`. Generated candidates, runs, reports, project metadata,
and local model/Vercel credentials are ignored; a fresh checkout can recreate
them with `pnpm deepsec scan --project-id seedyn`.

## Daily commands

```bash
pnpm deepsec scan
pnpm deepsec process     --concurrency 5
pnpm deepsec revalidate  --concurrency 5                  # cuts FP rate
pnpm deepsec export      --format md-dir --out ./findings
```

`--project-id` is auto-resolved while there's only one project in
`deepsec.config.ts`. Once you've added a second project, pass
`--project-id seedyn` (or whichever id you want) explicitly.

`scan` is free (regex only). `process` is the AI stage (≈$0.30/file
on Opus by default). Run state goes to `data/seedyn/`.

## Adding another project

To scan another codebase from this same `.deepsec/`:

```bash
pnpm deepsec init-project ../some-other-package   # path relative to .deepsec/
```

Appends an entry to `deepsec.config.ts` and writes the new project's context and
generated metadata. Review its setup prompt, fill in `INFO.md`, then delete the
prompt when initialization is complete.

## Layout

```
deepsec.config.ts        Project list (one entry per scanned repo)
data/seedyn/
  INFO.md                Repo context — checked into git, hand-curated
  project.json           Generated (gitignored)
  tech.json              Generated technology detection (gitignored)
  files/                 One JSON per scanned source file (gitignored)
  runs/                  Run metadata (gitignored)
  reports/               Generated markdown reports (gitignored)
AGENTS.md                Pointer for coding agents
.env.local               Tokens (gitignored)
```
